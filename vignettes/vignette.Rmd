## Informations about the vignette

In this vignette, you will find how to use the **rRice** package and it will be illustrated by examples. 
To use this package, you will have to create an experiment and then you will be able to work with it :
* Interrogate the databases
* Add manually databases
* Create an array with specific genes and properties

## Examples

### 1.) Create an experiment and add databases

The first thing you will have to do to use the package is to create a new experiment with the `createExperiment(name, locus)` function :
```
locus <- data.frame(ch = c("1"), st = c("148907"), end = c("248907"))
experiment <- createExperiment("newExperiment", locus)
```

Then you will have to follow instructions :
* First you will have to tell how many databases you want to experiment
* Then you will have to give the date of your experiment
* Finally, you will have to choose which databases to choose
    
After succeeding these steps, you will have an operational `experiment` you will be able to use. 

### 2.) Consult your experiment

If you want to collect the informations about your `experiment` :
* name : `experiment@name`
* date : `experiment@date`
* databases : `experiment@databases` will return all the databases you have add to your experiment
* genes : `experiment@genes` will return the list of the genes of all the databases you interrogated
* properties : `experiment@properties` will return the list of the properties you selected with `selectProperties(...)`
* others : `experiment@others` will contain a list with your personal informations you added with the function `addAttribute(...)`

### 3.) Add new databases to your experiment

If you wish to add new databases in your variable `experiment` then
